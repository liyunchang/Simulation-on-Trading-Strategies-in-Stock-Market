# Simulation-on-Trading-Strategies-in-Stock-Market

Abstract

This paper uses behavioral finance theory and computational experimental financial methods to build artificial stock market based on Netlogo. The artificial stock market is driven by events, and the market clearing mechanism and price formation mechanism are determined by the supply and demand relationship. There are two trading assets in the market, and there are several traders who randomly choose the four investment strategies.

The simulation analysis results show that the trend of the number of momentum traders is opposite to the change of the number of reverse traders, and the number of noise traders and rational traders is relatively stable. Herd behavior has a major impact on the number of noise traders. One of the reverse traders and the momentum trader can obtain significant excess returns, but at the same time it exhibits considerable volatility of returns, which means that investors are also exposed to a much greater risk.
